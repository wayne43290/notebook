https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/machine-learning-101/287/what_is_ml/

1. used to do classification/regression/finding relation from DATA
2. not 100% accurate (To apply neural network to enhance the accuracy)
3. simple Machine Learning Algor may cause underfitting, while complicate Machine Learning Algor may cause overfitting
4. DATA, we may not have enough DATA, or just have DATA with noises.

Steps:
1. grep characteristics from DATA, and also clean the DATA first.
2. train and test with certain Machine Learning Algor
3. tune params of the specific Machine Learning Algor
